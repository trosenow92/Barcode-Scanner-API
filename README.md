# Barcode-Scanner-API
API written for a mobile app called Barcode Scanner Terminal. This page processes scans of Barcodes and QR codes both individually and in mass numbers. This particular version was specialized for a local company who were scanning Employee ID badges as a means to replace their Timeclock system.

It is written using Adobe ColdFusion 11 and Microsoft SQL. It produces a bit of JSON that the mobile app needs to output a status message.
